const spoilerFree = `In the quiet town of Woodsboro, California, a mysterious killer in a Ghostface mask begins a brutal murder spree, starting with the shocking death of teenager Casey Becker. High school student Sidney Prescott, still reeling from the rape and murder of her mother Maureen one year earlier, quickly becomes the primary target.

As the body count rises, tabloid reporter Gale Weathers descends on the town for the story, while the well-meaning but inexperienced Deputy Dewey Riley tries to keep everyone safe. Sidney's boyfriend Billy Loomis becomes a suspect when he appears at her window moments after a Ghostface attack, but is released from custody.

The surviving teens gather at a house party hosted by the eccentric Stu Macher, where horror movie fanatic Randy Meeks lays out the 'rules' for surviving a horror film. But as the night progresses, the killer strikes again and again, and Sidney must summon all her courage to survive.

The film reinvented the slasher genre by combining genuine scares with self-aware humor and meta-commentary about horror film conventions, launching one of the most successful horror franchises in cinema history.`;

const fullPlot = `The film opens in Woodsboro, California, where teenager Casey Becker receives a phone call from a stranger who engages her in horror movie trivia. When the caller turns threatening, he reveals her boyfriend Steve Orth is tied up outside. Casey answers a trivia question incorrectly, leading to Steve's death. She is then chased and stabbed to death by someone in a Ghostface costume; her parents discover her disemboweled body hanging from a tree.

The next day, Sidney Prescott struggles with the approaching anniversary of her mother Maureen's murder, for which Cotton Weary was convicted based on Sidney's testimony. That evening, Sidney is attacked by Ghostface. Her boyfriend Billy Loomis appears at her window moments later and drops a cell phone, making Sidney suspect him. Billy is arrested but released when Sidney receives another threatening call while he's in custody.

At school, the students are placed under curfew. Principal Himbry is killed in his office. That night, Stu Macher throws a party at his house. Tatum Riley goes to the garage alone and is killed by Ghostface, who crushes her through the garage pet door. Billy arrives to reconcile with Sidney, and they have sex for the first time. Afterward, Ghostface attacks and apparently stabs Billy.

Sidney flees through the house. Gale's cameraman Kenny has his throat slashed. Dewey is stabbed in the back. Gale crashes her van trying to escape. Sidney locks herself inside with Randy and Stu each accusing the other of being the killer.

Billy appears at a window, seemingly wounded, and lets Randy inside -- then shoots Randy in the shoulder. Billy reveals himself as Ghostface, with Stu as his accomplice. The blood on Billy was fake (corn syrup). They reveal their plan: they killed Maureen Prescott because Billy's father had an affair with her, causing Billy's mother to leave the family. They framed Cotton Weary for Maureen's murder. Now they plan to kill Sidney and frame her father Neil (whom they've been holding hostage) for the entire new killing spree, using the anniversary of Maureen's death as motive.

Billy and Stu begin stabbing each other to appear as victims, but Gale returns and distracts them. Sidney escapes, puts on the Ghostface costume herself, and fights back. She drops a television on Stu's head, killing him. Gale shoots Billy. Randy warns that the killer always comes back for 'one last scare,' and indeed Billy lunges up -- but Sidney calmly shoots him in the forehead, killing him for good. Sidney, Gale, Dewey, Randy, and Neil Prescott all survive.`;
