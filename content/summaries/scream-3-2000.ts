const quickTake = "A new Ghostface targets the cast of 'Stab 3,' the latest sequel in the movie-within-a-movie franchise, drawing Sidney Prescott out of seclusion and to Hollywood where dark secrets about her mother's past are revealed.";

const spoilerFree = `Years after the Windsor College murders, Sidney Prescott has retreated into isolated anonymity, working as a crisis counselor from a remote California home. Meanwhile, in Hollywood, production is underway on 'Stab 3: Return to Woodsboro,' the latest film based on the Ghostface killings.

When Cotton Weary, now a successful talk show host, is murdered along with his girlfriend, a new Ghostface emerges -- this time targeting the actors of Stab 3. Detective Mark Kincaid brings Gale Weathers into the investigation, and she reconnects with Dewey Riley, who has been working as an adviser on the film set.

As the cast members are killed one by one, clues emerge pointing to dark secrets from Maureen Prescott's past -- her brief career as an actress in Hollywood under the name 'Rina Reynolds' and a traumatic event at a party hosted by producer John Milton. Sidney is drawn out of hiding when the killer begins using a voice changer to impersonate her dead mother.

The film explores the conclusion of a trilogy, both literally and meta-textually, as it satirizes Hollywood culture, the horror sequel machine, and the idea that in the final chapter, all rules are thrown out and the past comes back to haunt the present.`;

const fullPlot = `Cotton Weary, now a successful Los Angeles talk show host, is contacted by Ghostface, who demands Sidney Prescott's location. When Cotton refuses, the killer murders both Cotton and his girlfriend Christine in their home.

Detective Mark Kincaid contacts Gale Weathers about the murder. In Hollywood, production on 'Stab 3: Return to Woodsboro' is underway, with Dewey Riley working as a technical adviser. Gale arrives and clashes with Jennifer Jolie, the actress portraying her in the Stab films. Parker Posey's Jennifer Jolie becomes an unlikely ally to Gale as they investigate together.

Ghostface begins killing Stab 3 cast members in the order they die in the script: Sarah Darling is murdered, then bodyguard Steven Stone is stabbed and Tom Prinze is killed in a gas explosion at Jennifer's house. The killer leaves photos of a young Maureen Prescott at each crime scene.

Sidney has been living in seclusion under an alias, working as a crisis counselor for an abused women's hotline. When the killer begins taunting her using a voice changer that mimics her dead mother, Sidney travels to Hollywood. Gale and Jennifer discover that Maureen once worked as an actress under the name 'Rina Reynolds' and was raped at a party held by producer John Milton.

Jamie Kennedy appears in a posthumous video cameo as Randy Meeks, who recorded a tape before his death explaining the rules of surviving the final film in a trilogy: the killer is superhuman, anyone can die including the main character, and the past will come back.

At Roman Bridger's birthday party, Ghostface strikes again. Gale finds Roman's body with a knife in his back in a coffin on a movie set in the basement. Tyson Fox, Jennifer Jolie, and Angelina Tyler are all killed. Ghostface captures Gale and Dewey, then summons Sidney to the Milton estate.

Sidney arrives and confronts the killer, who reveals himself as Roman Bridger -- alive, having faked his death. Roman is Maureen Prescott's son, born after she was raped during her time as a young actress. When he sought out his birth mother, Maureen rejected him. Consumed by jealousy and rage, Roman tracked down Billy Loomis, showed him evidence of his father's affair with Maureen, and convinced Billy to murder her -- making Roman the hidden mastermind behind the original Scream murders.

Roman kills producer John Milton by slashing his throat as retribution for the rape of his mother. In the climactic fight, Sidney stabs Roman, and Dewey shoots him multiple times. Roman appears to die but gets back up (wearing a bulletproof vest), only for Dewey to shoot him in the head, killing him for good.

Sidney, Gale, Dewey, and Detective Kincaid all survive. The film ends with Sidney leaving her front door open, symbolizing her finally moving past her fear. Scream 3 is notably the only film in the franchise with a single Ghostface killer acting alone.`;
