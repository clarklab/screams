const quickTake = "On the 15th anniversary of the original Woodsboro murders, Sidney Prescott returns to her hometown for a book tour only to find a new Ghostface killer targeting a new generation of teens, including her young cousin Jill.";

const spoilerFree = `Fifteen years after the original Woodsboro massacre, Sidney Prescott has written a self-help book and returns to her hometown on a book tour. But her arrival coincides with a new wave of Ghostface murders targeting local teenagers, including her cousin Jill Roberts and Jill's circle of friends.

Sheriff Dewey Riley leads the investigation while his wife Gale Weathers-Riley, struggling with writer's block, launches her own investigation. The new generation of potential victims includes horror-savvy Kirby Reed, cinema club members Charlie Walker and Robbie Mercer, and Jill's friend Olivia Morris.

The new Ghostface operates with an awareness of horror remakes and reboots, following what the teens identify as the 'rules of the reboot' -- where the original characters are no longer safe and a new cast must carry the story forward. The kills are being livestreamed and documented, reflecting the social media age.

As the body count rises and the suspects narrow, Sidney must once again fight to survive while protecting the next generation. The film serves as both a sequel and a meta-commentary on the reboot/remake culture that dominated horror cinema in the 2000s and 2010s, and was the final film directed by Wes Craven before his death in 2015.`;

const fullPlot = `On the 15th anniversary of the original Woodsboro murders, high school students Marnie Cooper and Jenny Randall are murdered by Ghostface. Sidney Prescott arrives in Woodsboro on a book tour promoting her self-help memoir, accompanied by her publicist Rebecca Walters. When evidence from the murders is found in Sidney's rental car, she becomes a suspect and is ordered to remain in town.

Sidney reconnects with her aunt Kate Roberts and cousin Jill Roberts, a teenager dealing with the infidelity of her ex-boyfriend Trevor Sheldon. Jill, her best friend Kirby Reed, and friend Olivia Morris all receive threatening calls from Ghostface. Cinema club members Charlie Walker and Robbie Mercer theorize the killer is following the rules of horror remakes.

Gale Weathers-Riley, experiencing writer's block, begins her own investigation with help from Charlie and Robbie, setting up cameras at a 'Stab-a-thon' screening event. Ghostface attacks Gale at the event, stabbing her. Sidney's publicist Rebecca is murdered in a parking garage. Officers Deputy Hoss and Deputy Perkins, assigned to guard Jill's house, are both killed. Olivia Morris is murdered in her bedroom while Jill and Kirby watch helplessly from next door.

Sidney's aunt Kate Roberts is stabbed to death by Ghostface on her own front porch. Sidney rushes to find Jill, who is missing. At Kirby's house, Charlie is found seemingly tied up and tortured. When Kirby frees him, he immediately stabs her, revealing himself as Ghostface.

Sidney arrives and is confronted by both Charlie and a second Ghostface, who unmasks as Jill Roberts. Jill reveals her motive: she is consumed with jealousy over the fame Sidney received as a survivor of the original massacre. In the age of social media and internet celebrity, Jill wants to be the new 'final girl,' engineering her own survival story. She plans to frame her ex-boyfriend Trevor as the sole killer.

Jill shoots Trevor in the head and the groin, then turns on Charlie and stabs him to death -- she never intended to share the spotlight. She stabs Sidney and then injures herself (throwing herself into furniture, pulling her own hair, stabbing herself) to convincingly appear as a victim.

Dewey and the police arrive and both Sidney and Jill are taken to the hospital. When Jill learns Sidney survived surgery, she frantically goes to finish her off. In the hospital room, Jill attacks Sidney, but Sidney fights back. Dewey and Gale realize Jill is the killer when she references details about Gale's stabbing that weren't public knowledge. In the final confrontation, Sidney uses a defibrillator on Jill and then shoots her in the chest, killing her.

Sidney, Gale, and Dewey survive. Kirby Reed's fate was left ambiguous (later confirmed as a survivor in Scream 2022/VI). The film had the franchise's highest body count at fourteen victims.`;
