const spoilerFree = `Two years after the horrific events in Woodsboro, Sidney Prescott is trying to put her life back together as a drama student at Windsor College in Ohio. But the release of 'Stab,' a movie based on Gale Weathers' book about the murders, attracts unwanted attention -- and a new Ghostface killer.

The terror begins when two students, Maureen Evans and Phil Stevens, are murdered at a sneak preview of 'Stab.' As the campus goes on high alert, familiar faces converge: Dewey Riley arrives to protect Sidney, Gale Weathers covers the story, and fellow survivor Randy Meeks finds himself once again in danger.

The new Ghostface seems to be following the rules of horror sequels -- bigger body count, more elaborate kills, and more suspects than ever. Sidney must navigate her trauma, her relationships, and a web of deception as the killer picks off those around her one by one.

The film explores themes of media exploitation, the copycat phenomenon, and the way horror sequels reflect and amplify the fears of the original, all while delivering genuine suspense and the franchise's trademark self-aware humor.`;

const fullPlot = `Two years after the Woodsboro murders, Sidney Prescott is attending Windsor College under a new identity. A film called 'Stab,' based on Gale Weathers' book about the killings, is about to premiere. At the screening, Phil Stevens is murdered in a bathroom stall by Ghostface, who then sits beside Phil's girlfriend Maureen Evans and stabs her repeatedly. Maureen staggers to the front of the theater and collapses dead onstage, while the audience initially mistakes it for a publicity stunt.

The murders draw media frenzy to campus. Reporter Debbie Salt arrives alongside Gale Weathers. Sidney's friend group includes her roommate Hallie McDaniel, boyfriend Derek Feldman, horror buff Mickey Altieri, and fellow Woodsboro survivor Randy Meeks. Dewey arrives to protect Sidney. Sorority sister Cici Cooper is murdered during a party.

Randy receives a phone call from the killer while on the campus lawn with Gale, Dewey, and cameraman Joel. As Gale and Dewey search for the caller, Randy is pulled into Joel's news van and stabbed to death. That evening, Dewey and Gale discover footage but are attacked by Ghostface, who stabs Dewey multiple times.

Sidney and Hallie are being driven to a safe house when Ghostface kills their police escorts and causes a crash. They escape past the unconscious killer in the car, but Sidney goes back to unmask them, and the killer vanishes. Ghostface then kills Hallie.

Sidney flees to the college theater, where she finds Derek tied to a cross in what appears to be a fraternity prank. Mickey enters with a gun and reveals himself as one of the killers. He shoots Derek dead. Mickey explains his plan to be caught and blame movie violence in a sensational trial.

Debbie Salt then appears holding Gale at gunpoint and removes her disguise -- she is Nancy Loomis, Billy's mother. She financed Mickey's killing spree as revenge against Sidney for killing Billy and against Maureen Prescott for having an affair with her husband. She personally killed Randy for badmouthing Billy. Nancy double-crosses Mickey and shoots him.

Cotton Weary arrives and is briefly manipulated by Nancy, who offers him fame if he kills Sidney. Instead, Cotton shoots Nancy. Mickey suddenly revives but is shot to death by both Sidney and Gale. Sidney shoots Nancy once more in the head to ensure she's dead. In the aftermath, Dewey is revealed to have survived his injuries. Sidney, Gale, Dewey, and Cotton all survive.`;
