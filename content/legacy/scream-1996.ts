  criticalReception:
    "Scream was a critical sensation upon release, earning widespread praise for reinventing the slasher genre. Critics lauded Kevin Williamson's razor-sharp screenplay for its clever deconstruction of horror tropes and Wes Craven's masterful direction that balanced genuine terror with knowing humor. The film holds a 79% on Rotten Tomatoes with critics calling it the most important horror film of the 1990s.",
  culturalImpact:
    "Scream single-handedly revived the slasher genre, which had been considered dead since the late 1980s. The Ghostface mask became an iconic piece of pop culture, the film spawned countless imitators (I Know What You Did Last Summer, Urban Legend), and it launched a new era of self-aware horror. Its meta-commentary on horror rules created a template that influenced the genre for decades.",
