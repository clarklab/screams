  criticalReception:
    "Scream VI was praised for its bold choices, including moving the setting to New York City and featuring the franchise's first opening-scene twist. Critics highlighted the more brutal tone, the subway sequence, and the Ghostface shrine reveal as standout moments. The film holds a 75% on Rotten Tomatoes, though Neve Campbell's absence as Sidney was noted as a loss.",
  culturalImpact:
    "Scream VI pushed the franchise in new directions: the first film set outside of a small town, the first with three simultaneous Ghostface killers, and the first without Sidney Prescott. The Ghostface shrine scene -- displaying artifacts from every previous massacre -- served as a love letter to franchise history. The film's exploration of online conspiracy theories and family vengeance reflected contemporary anxieties about misinformation and radicalization.",
