  criticalReception:
    "The 2022 Scream was widely praised as a worthy continuation of the franchise, earning strong reviews for its sharp commentary on toxic fandom and the legacy sequel trend. Directors Matt Bettinelli-Olpin and Tyler Gillett were lauded for honoring Wes Craven's legacy while finding their own voice. The film holds a 76% on Rotten Tomatoes, with particular praise for Jenna Ortega's breakout performance.",
  culturalImpact:
    "Scream (2022) proved the franchise could survive without Wes Craven, delivering a pointed critique of toxic fandom and the entitled possessiveness fans feel over beloved franchises. Dewey Riley's death was a franchise-first -- the first time a legacy trio member was killed -- and it shocked audiences. The concept of the 'requel' (reboot/sequel hybrid) entered the pop culture lexicon. The film is dedicated 'For Wes.'",
