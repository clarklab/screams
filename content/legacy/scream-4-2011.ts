  criticalReception:
    "Scream 4 received generally positive reviews for bringing Kevin Williamson back as writer and updating the franchise's meta-commentary for the social media age. Critics praised Hayden Panettiere's Kirby Reed and the film's sharp satire of remake culture, though some felt it played things too safe. The film holds a 60% on Rotten Tomatoes.",
  culturalImpact:
    "Scream 4 was Wes Craven's final film before his death in 2015, giving it a bittersweet legacy. Its commentary on fame, social media, and the remake/reboot trend was ahead of its time. Jill Roberts' motive -- wanting to be famous as a survivor rather than as a filmmaker -- anticipated the culture of internet celebrity. Kirby Reed became a fan-favorite character whose ambiguous fate sparked years of debate until her return in Scream VI.",
