  criticalReception:
    "Scream 3 received the most mixed reviews of the Wes Craven entries, with critics noting the shift to a more comedic tone and the absence of Kevin Williamson's writing. However, the Hollywood setting and Parker Posey's scene-stealing performance were widely praised. The film holds a 41% on Rotten Tomatoes but has been somewhat reappraised over time for its satirical take on Hollywood.",
  culturalImpact:
    "Scream 3 was notably impacted by the Columbine shooting, leading to reduced violence and a more comedic tone. Despite mixed reception, the film's revelation that Roman Bridger masterminded the entire franchise retroactively recontextualized every previous film. Its Hollywood satire, including the 'casting couch' subplot involving producer John Milton, proved prescient in light of the #MeToo movement.",
