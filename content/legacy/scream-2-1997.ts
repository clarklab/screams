  criticalReception:
    'Scream 2 was praised as a rare horror sequel that matched the quality of its predecessor. Critics appreciated the film\'s exploration of sequel culture and its willingness to kill off beloved characters. The film holds a 81% on Rotten Tomatoes, with particular praise for the opening theater sequence and the emotional weight of returning characters.',
  culturalImpact:
    "Scream 2 cemented the franchise as a cultural phenomenon and proved that meta-horror could sustain a sequel. The film's commentary on sequels within a sequel was ahead of its time, and its exploration of copycat violence and media exploitation remains relevant. Randy Meeks' death shocked audiences and raised the stakes for the franchise.",
